Question 1 Timer0 Tick

Modify the example program Timer0_Ex_10ms.c (available on Sulis under \Example Programs to toggle the bits of PORTD at exactly 5ms intervals – no approximations allowed.
Note: a prescaler ratio of 256 won’t work. Note also: you may not need a rollover counter.

Question 2 ADC Initialization

Set up the Analog to Digital Converter as follows:
	Select Chanel 5 of the ADMUX
	ADC Left Adjust disabled (ADLAR=0)
	Select the AVCC as the referenced voltage input (assume = 5.0V)
	Enable the ADC
	Set the ADC to Automatic Re-Trigger Mode, with Timer/Counter1 Capture Event as the trigger
	Set the Clock Prescaler to 64
	Start the ADC and enable its interrupt request
(Hint: use the ADMUX and ADCSRA and ADCSRB registers to set these options. You can ignore ACME of ADCSRB)
*/

void anolog_digital_Preferences()
{
	ADMUX = 01000101; // AVCC set as the referenced voltage, ADLAR disabled and channel five selected.
	ADCSRA = 11101110; // ADEN = 1,  ADSC = 1, ADATE = 1, ADIF = 0, ADIE =1, prescaler set to 64.
	ADCSRB = 00000111; // ACME = 0, Timer/Counter1 Capture Event set as the trigger.

/*
Question 3 ADC Resolution

In an ATMega328P application, an external AREF Voltage of 3.3V has been set as the Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) reference voltage, so this is the full-scale voltage, Vfs. Answer the following questions, assuming a 10-bit ADC:
	i. What is the resolution of the ADC in this configuration?
			The resolution in this configuration is 3.22*10^-3.
	ii. If the input voltage applied to the ADC is 2.765V, what result would you expect to read from the ADC register, which holds the conversion result?
			The Reading from the ADC Register is 857.
	iii. If the ADC result register has the data 0x319 (793), what voltage was applied at the ADC input pin?
			The Voltage applied at the input pin is 2.556 Volts.

/*
Question 4 Timer – Interval or Tick setting

Modify either the example program Timer0_Ex.c or Timer0_Ex_10ms.c (both available on Sulis under \Example Programs to toggle the bits of PORTD at exactly 50ms intervals – no approximations allowed – but this time using Timer2 in place of Timer0.
You may assume that the ATMega328P is clocked at 16MHz, but you may need to modify the clock division ratio and the number of timer interrupts used for the required delay (timecount0).
The structure of the program will be the same. Refer to the ATMega328P data sheet for descriptions of the ATMega328P Timer2 registers.
